# Sell
I'm specifically talking about wholesale selling my tools as standalone products. This implies that the tool isn't being used within an existing commercial product and has just been outright ripped and/or my copyright removed and sold without my consent. This is STRICTLY forbidden. Whether you've put it on a storefront or are hiding it behind donations. If my code and ONLY my code is hidden behind ANY paywall, this is a violation of my license

However, The above line applies doubly to any games. You can NOT sell any of my games.. Even in pieces. Do NOT sell my games for money at ALL. The "sell" section only applies to TOOLS that have been specifically made to be sold with programs as libraries or little backend tools
