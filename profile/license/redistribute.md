### Redistribute
Only in the event that all official sources go down. You MUST also provide the unaltered source code WITH copyrights. Additionally. Unless explicitly stated, Assume that packaging my code with your games is forbidden. I **WILL** make exceptions to **SOME** programs and state it in it's own readme. If you have included a tool of mine within a game or have forked an existing game of mine, you MUST link back to the original source if possible. Do NOT include the source code within your download. PLEASe include a link back here in the event that you're using an outdated version. Additionally, if your game, tool etc that uses my code is open source, Please do not include any of my code within your project in the event that it's an entire program that you're using. Please add a little note to your readme that the reader requires a tool and link to it. Plus, adding pre-compiled binaries to source code is always iffy. The Exception to this is redistributing it with the intent of adding malware to it. Whether via a shady installer or by forking it
