# Fork
You have my full permission to fork my code. Granted, I request you to either leave my copyrights (if any) intact and add a little disclaimer. Even if it's just a little mention in a readme file.

Please use one of the following

```
By {YOUR USERNAME HERE}
[Original by Pikakid98 / https://pikakid98.github.io]
```

```
By {YOUR USERNAME HERE}
[Forked from Pikakid98's {MY PROGRAM} / {LINK TO PROGRAM}]
```

Another requirement is to state in the name of your fork that it IS a fork. Let's say I made a program called `VeryCoolNotepad`. Please call your fork something like `VeryCoolNotepad-{YOURUSERNAME}` or `VeryCoolNotePad-fork`
